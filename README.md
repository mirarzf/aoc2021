C++ wannabe solutions for advent of code 2021 
All the proposed algorithms you may find in this repo don't necessarily work or are the most efficient. 
You can take them and do whatever you want, just remind yourself that reusing the portion from my code is at your own risk. 

Every problem will have its solution in the folder corresponding to its day of release. For each day you can find: the C++ code, the application, a test file (corresponding to the problem short data) and my puzzle input. The input files are .txt files.
